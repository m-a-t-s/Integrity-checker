# Integrity-checker

Bash tool to check the integrity of a file

Here's how you can use the script:

1. Save the script to a file (e.g. hash_check.sh) on your Linux machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
3. Make the script executable with the command chmod +x hash_check.sh.
4. Run the script with the command ./hash_check.sh.
5. Follow the prompts to enter the filename of the file to hash and the filename of the reference hash file.
6. The script will calculate the SHA-256 hash of the file and compare it to the reference hash. It will output a message indicating whether the integrity check was successful or failed.
